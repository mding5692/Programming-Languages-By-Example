# Nim has three variable types: 
# var for variable
# const for constant
# and let for variables whose values can be dynamically assigned but not changed aftewards
# unlike constants which need to be assigned before compiling

# strings

var str = "string"

const g = "constant"

# this works too
var 
  a = 1
  b = "hello"
  c = 2
  
let d = "this is a let variable"
